                        Yong's Kitchen name comes from the Chef Owner's name: Jooyong. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He came to Australia in 2012, as a young chef who was eager to learn various cuisines in the multicultural foodie city of Melbourne. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Over the last few years, he has worked at various places, learning the secret recipes of many different cuisines along the way. 
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                        Then he wonders, with such a wide range of recipes under his belt, what is the best way to let many people try them all?
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                        After a strike of inspiration hits (and some money saved up), he finally opened Yong's Kitchen. It is truly a perfect place for him to be, because he can utilise all his recipes, while reaching many people.
